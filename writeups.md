# CTF Writeups
Here you can find various writeups I've made on different CTF challenges I've completed. Most of them will be from Hack the Box.

## [HTB Season II - Cybermonday](/writeups/machines/htb-cybermonday/1-initial-enumeration)
A hard machine from the season two releases from HTB, with many steps needed to even obtain a shell. As the first hard box I've done I struggled in a few places, but having had experience with Docker, I found obtaining root relatively simple.

<!-- ## [HTB Season II - Keeper](/writeups/htb-keeper)
A machine from the season two releases from HTB. A Linux machine that involves a ticketing system and a Keepass exploit. An easy start to seasonal challenges. -->
## [HTB Hardware Challenge - Prison Escape](/writeups/challenges/htb-prison-escape)
A hardware challenge from HTB. It involves interpreting RF packet data to decipher the protocol being used. I thought this challenge was okay but made harder by an unclear UI and contradictory responses.
